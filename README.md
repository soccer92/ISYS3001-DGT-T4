To run locally, run the commands in Terminal/Command Prompt in the project directory directly:

npm i
-Should only have to run "npm run db:init/seed" once and skip straight to npm dev
npm run db:init
npm run db:seed
npm dev

then you can access the web application via the url link that is provided in the terminal.
